# Museum-Image-Cluster
[KMeans](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) cluster on a set of images **on their metadata.**


#### The images

This set of images represents more than 400 works of fine art from museum collections and galleries across several countries, curated and analyzed for inspiration and information on effective ways to visually communicate uncertainty, ambiguity, and vulnerability. The selected artworks were chosen for their unique ability to convey ***uncertainty*** using a range of approaches and techniques. The images are being used to inspire better design of visual representations of uncertainty in data, because [traditional methods and techniques aren't working very well](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-its-so-hard-for-us-to-visualize-uncertainty).
